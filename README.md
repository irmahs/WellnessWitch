# üßÉ Wellness Witch

A simple full-stack .NET web app that lets users select and mix ingredients to create wellness shots. If the combination matches a known recipe, it's unlocked. If not, it's saved as a "Mystery Wellness."

Built using **ASP.NET Core (Razor Pages)** and **C#**, this app keeps front-end and back-end in one unified folder structure. It's perfect for learning and creative expression.
